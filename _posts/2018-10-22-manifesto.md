Budgeting is funky - and I want to try and fix it

The number 1 rule of managing your money {efficiently} is by budgeting.
Budgeting helps you organize your money and view it instead of letting your
banks be a black hole. Budgeting also helps you {to be aware} of untamed
unexpected expenses. All in all, budgeting {helps} you think about the money
you have in your bank account and {foresee} where you want to spend it.

Dealing with your finances should include {#} basic components:
1. Budgets
2. {Transaction imports}
3. Analysis/Reporting

We’ll talk about each one and each of it’s sub-components later, but these are
the bare minimum required to show you a picture of your financial standing.

There are a great deal of already existing tools out there for budgeting. I
myself have tried Mint, EveryDollar, YNAB, and Excel spreadsheets for tracking
my finances and budgeting. I wasn’t satisfied with them because they didn’t
really give me a holistic picture of my finances. 

What’s wrong with Mint?
Auto-categorization. While many of us enjoy the magic categorization that Mint
provides, it somewhat defeats the purpose of “managing” finances. 

Your finances should not be on auto-pilot and every transaction/purchase you
make should be acknowledged by you. Also, since categorization in Mint is done
by software, it isn’t very accurate either, thereby bringing your financial
image misrepresented to you.  

What’s wrong with EveryDollar?
While EveryDollar satisfies the above mentioned auto-pilot problem of having
every transaction go from under your eyes, EveryDollar is the bare-bare minimum
you can get for your dime. By that I mean the reporting abilities. EveryDollar
does show you a simple pie-char of your overall budget, but does not give you
an intuitive, yet detailed overview of where you stand financially.

What’s wrong with YNAB?
YNAB is by far the best budgeting tool in the market with it’s 4 fundamental
rules, but it does lack a few minor tweaks here and there. 
{enter details}

What’s wrong with an Excel budget template?
Nothing. Really. If you can set it up, hook up all the formulas, and keep
entering every transaction/expense you make, you can really fine tune it to
suit your needs.

——
All the above tools are just fine. If it suits your need, you can track your
expenses and be financially fit even using a pen and paper.

But trying to solve a problem is more about finding a generalized solution. And
a generalized solution is the one that suits many people.
The question really is; will you give up budgeting because it’s hard or a
hassle? 

How I see it should be
Budgeting essentially comprises of the following steps:
1. Categorization: know where your money is going every month
2. Entering transactional data: when you make an expense, you enter and
expense. Simple
3. Adjusting yourself (or your categories) according to your spending
patterns
