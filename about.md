Hi, I am Pradyumna Shembekar. I go by PD for short.

I am currently working at ClearStack, Inc. in Portland, OR as a Ruby developer. Most of the
time you'll find me on the terminal.

I use vim to write code, draft ideas, and create grocery lists.

I like to automate menial tasks, hence I love aliasing and bash functions. (I
may spend a lot of time on automating a small repetitive task.)

I also love products, thinking about architectural design, and refactoring code.
