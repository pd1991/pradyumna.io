Hi, I am Pradyumna Shembekar. I go by PD for short.

I am currently working at ClearStack, Inc. in Portland, OR as a Ruby developer. Most of the
time you'll find me on the terminal.

Currently, I am working on <a href="http://52.42.138.175/" target="_blank">Expensa</a> - which is an open source expense tracking application.
Here is the <a href="https://gitlab.com/pradyumna2905/expensa" target="_blank">source code</a> if you are interested.

I use vim to write code, draft ideas, and create grocery lists.

I like to automate menial tasks, hence I love aliasing and bash functions. (I
may spend a lot of time on automating a small repetitive task.)

I also love products, thinking about architectual design, and refactoring code.

I am currently reading <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6516450-what-the-dog-saw-and-other-adventures" target="_blank">What the Dog Saw</a>, by <a href="https://twitter.com/Gladwell" target="_blank">Malcolm Gladwell</a>.

Here is my social precence.
